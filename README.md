# Simple vibecoded elevator simulator

Initially written by copilot, needed something to upload so I could set up and experiment with pipeline.

## Current todo: 
- Split code into more sensible classes 
- Squash bugs (mostly visual as of now)
- Fix elevator logic

## Next step: 
- Having the engine move people in logical order

## Why

I thought it might be an interesting exercise to make sense of a completely AI-generated code and basically completely refactor it into something more manageable and palateable. 

If nothing, I've successfully set up a work pipeline and a little thing to play with in your browser.
