# Simple vibecoded elevator simulator

Mostly (completely) written by copilot, needed something to upload so I could set up and experiment with pipeline. 

## Current todo: 
- Split code into more sensible classes 
- Squash bugs (mostly visual as of now)
- Fix elevator logic
- De-vibe the code

## Why

I thought it might be an interesting exercise to make sense of a completely AI-generated code and basically completely refactor it into something more manageable and palateable. 

If nothing, I've successfully set up a work pipeline and a little thing to play with in your browser.
