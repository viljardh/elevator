# Simple vibecoded elevator simulator

Initially written by copilot, needed something to upload so I could set up and experiment with pipeline. Most of it has been rewritten and handled, but due to exams it's on hold.

## Current todo: 
- Split code into more sensible classes (mostly done) 
- Squash bugs (mostly visual as of now)
- Fix elevator logic

## Next step: 
- Having the engine move people in logical order

## Why

It started as an idea and discussion between a few of my friends where we just wondered: "Huh, how do elevators actually think?" The answer was rather pedestrian, but it still made for a fun little project. 

I thought it might be an interesting exercise to make sense of a completely AI-generated code and basically completely refactor it into something more manageable and palateable. 

If nothing, I've successfully set up a work pipeline and a little thing to play with in your browser.
